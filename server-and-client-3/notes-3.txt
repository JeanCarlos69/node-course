in app.js:

we use the middleware ".use()" to run a function, the extra parameter called "next" to make it 
go to the next middleware so the page won't be hanging. example

app.use((req,res, next) =>{
    console.log('New request made: ');
    console.log('host: ', req.hostname);
    console.log('path: ', req.path);
    console.log('method: ', req.method);
    next();
});


static file are the one that we are going to make public such as images, css styles, etc...

the server protects everything so we have to specify what files should be public
app.use(express.static(name_of_the_folder_here)) in this midddleware we're making able the "public" 
folder with our files

we don't want the server listening to a request until the connection has been made  
mongoose.connect(dbURL, {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
        .then(result => app.listen(3036))
        .catch(err => console.log(err))
