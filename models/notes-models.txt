an Schema is the thing that define how will be our db

model provides us with an interface by which to communicate with a db collection for that document type

const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blogSchema);

the name it's important because it'd look for the blogs collection in oir mongoDB  adding an 's' to it

so first argument is the name and the second is the Schema
